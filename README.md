## 🧠 What is HabitHow?

HabitHow is more than a habit tracker. It’s a mindset tool. You define your big goals, break them into timelines, those into daily habits — and track progress like a ledger.

Key features:
- ⏱️ The 30-Minute Rule (start your day right)
- 📊 Visual habit ledger with `/` for partial, `X` for done
- 🧱 Goals → Timelines → Habits → Daily routine
- 📆 Streak counters, milestone countdowns
- 📱 iOS widget-first experience (coming soon)
